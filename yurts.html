        What is a yurt?
    </strong>
</dt>

    Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
    ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a
    wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.

    <strong>
        How are the yurts furnished?
    </strong>
</dt>

<dd>
    Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt
    and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes
    electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower
    and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

    <strong>
        What should I bring?
    </strong>
</dt>

<dd>
    Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
    changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also
    helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
